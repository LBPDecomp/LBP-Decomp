# LBP-Decomp
This is the repository where many great things will happen in an effort to decompile the mainline LBP games. We plan to make it more possible than ever to make the game more secure and make modding a whole lot easier.
## Legal Disclaimers
This repository contains only our own original source code. We do not bundle any textures, audio, or level files from the official game. You must supply your own. See more in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/LBPDecomp/LBP-Decomp/blob/main/LICENSE) file and at the bottom of this page.
## Why?
This was initially created because of the custom server shutdown in 2025. An exploit was discovered where players could forcibly join others without any prior consent. This could allow malicious users to run custom scripts in the host's game without their permission and possibly corrupt the host's account, delete savedata, or even worse. This was created so that this security oversight can be fixed, allowing custom servers to run again and in the process make it much easier for the modding community to figure out how the game works and do their thing.
## What have we done so far?
Nothing except creating this repo, however this is a big first step!

 ### DISCLAIMER
This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sony Interactive Entertainment or Media Molecule. This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the games. We believe this project qualifies under U.S. fair use (or similar doctrines in other jurisdictions) because we:
1. Only reference functional behavior from the original (no expressive content is directly copied).
2. Produce our own, entirely original engine code.
3. Do not distribute any copyrighted game assets.
